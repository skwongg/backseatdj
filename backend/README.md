Backseat DJ is a mobile web app designed to allow the passengers in a car besides shotgun to collaboratively vote on songs to play, songs to skip, and songs to repeat. This app was created using the SoundCloud API including SoundCloud O-Auth.

The front end of this web application consists of a mobile first css library using a Sinatra skeleton framework. In the future, there will be native iOS and Android applications bring this app to life.

The back end is designed solely to act as an API to maintain a decoupled architecture design pattern. The Rails API back end features a PostgreSQL database for the user, playlist, and song data. Firebase was implemented to manage the votes from multiple users simultaneously.
